# 🎙️ Inzwa – The Fluent Shona Voice Assistant

*“Hey Inzwa-ka, zviri sei?”*

**Inzwa** is an open-source, real-time, conversational **voice assistant** specifically built to understand, reason, and fluently respond in **Shona**. Using cutting-edge open-source AI technology (**Whisper.cpp**, **Mistral LLM**, **Coqui TTS**), Inzwa delivers rapid, accurate, and natural conversations, designed explicitly for the Shona-speaking community.

---

## 🌟 Key Features:

- ✅ **Real-time Voice Interaction:** Sub-second latency conversation flow.
- ✅ **Fluent Shona:** Understands and speaks Shona with high accuracy and natural fluency.
- ✅ **Fully Open Source:** Built entirely on open-source software with zero licensing fees.
- ✅ **Accessible:** Designed for zero-budget or low-cost deployment.
- ✅ **Privacy-Focused:** Run entirely offline or on a local server.

## 📽️ Demo (coming soon):

- 🎙️ **Real-time voice assistant**: Speak naturally, get instant answers in Shona.
- 🔗 Live demo link coming soon (HuggingFace Spaces, Fly.io demo).

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Architecture:

**End-to-End conversational pipeline:**

- **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**:
  - [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for fast, accurate, quantized inference (CPU/GPU optimized).

- **Conversational AI (LLM)**:
  - [Mistral LLM](https://mistral.ai/) fine-tuned using [PEFT LoRA](https://github.com/huggingface/peft).

- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**:
  - [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) using VITS for natural-sounding Shona voice synthesis.

- **Backend & APIs**:
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Quart](https://github.com/pallets/quart) for robust real-time voice streaming APIs.

- **Deployment**:
  - Containerized via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
  - CI/CD pipeline automated using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## 🚩 Latency & Performance Optimization:

To maintain conversational naturalness (latency <1 sec):

* Whisper.cpp INT8 quantization (CPU/GPU inference)
* Incremental ASR transcription & LLM inference (streaming via vLLM)
* Real-time Coqui TTS streaming inference

*(Ongoing optimizations tracked via GitHub issues.)*
